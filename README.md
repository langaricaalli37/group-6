## TO DO LIST:
- classes do not include the coding that is only presented in main tab
- start and gameover screens
- getting the code to work

## EDITORS NOTE:
- all the added files: player, berrys fixed, etc. those were not needed the code was already good because berries already has their own class
- p.s flowers dont need their own tab, its already in the map pnd btw if your wondering why its getting deleted

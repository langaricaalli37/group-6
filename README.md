## TO DO LIST:
- classes do not include the coding that is only presented in main tab
- start and gameover screens
- getting the code to work

## EDITORS NOTE:
- I made a new folder called data folder for a picture and font, make sure when your checking the code not to mix data up with the source codes
- I also finished the starting screen and updated the source code. I noticed that you were editing the code again so I'm just letting you know
- I edited: char, PImage, PFont, void setup, void draw, void mousePressed, the Button class, I added void drawStart, and I added mousePressed
- p.s flowers dont need their own tab, its already in the map pnd btw if your wondering why its getting deleted

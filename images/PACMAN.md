PACMAN   
 

Pac-Man is a classic maze-style game where the player controls a yellow character who moves through a series of mazes, eating small pellets while avoiding four ghosts. The main goal is to clear the maze by eating every pellet without getting caught. Power Pellets, located in each corner of the maze, give Pac-Man the temporary ability to eat the ghosts for extra points. Occasionally, bonus fruit appears for additional scoring opportunities.The game requires both quick reactions and smart movement, as the ghosts become faster and more unpredictable with each level. Its simple design, bright visuals, and engaging gameplay make Pac-Man an enjoyable and challenging experience that continues to stand out among other classic games
